# GitHub Action - Adds release comments to PRs v2
This action iterates through all PRs that are part of a release and adds a comment to each of them. It runs only when triggered by a `release` event and a `published` action.

# What's new
- Added a new input parameter for specifying custom body text for the posted comment
- Improved documentation

Refer [here](https://github.com/rdlf0/comment-released-prs-action/blob/v1/README.md) for previous versions.

# Usage
## Inputs
### `repo-token`
**Required** The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret.

### `comment-body`
Place to set your own custom text for the posted comment. If omitted, the default message shown in the [image below](#posted-comment) will be used. Supports markdown syntax and emojis (see [example](#example-workflow)). The text can contain properties of the release in the form of `{{propertyName}}`. Full list of available properties can be found in the [table below](#available-release-properties).

## Outputs
### `pr-ids`
List of the IDs of the commented PRs
